Backlog

The team created a backlog with improvements and missing features they think are necessary. You can choose to pick up work from this list. It is too much work for one day, youâ€™re not expected to do all of it. If you think there are more urgent changes necessary you can also choose to work on those.
- The code was written in Python 2, which is end-of life. Convert it to Python 3. -> Done?
- It's only a static database. A service that preloads all the data into RAM would be faster.
- It would be nice if, when asked for a project, there is already a list shown of projects -> Done
- If there are no actions, there is an error. It should congratulate the user instead.
- When adding a task a deadline before today shouldn't be accepted. -> Done
- When adding a task the date format should be clarified in the prompt. -> Done
- Using sql.py the error message could be cleaner if the input isn't valid SQL.
- add.py works with an interactive prompt, could also support a list of arguments from the command line. Could use Python argparse for this. -> Done
- A command line tool is a bit scary for most users. A GUI would be more friendly
- The installation is a bit cumbersome, and sometimes there are problems because of differences in environments. Write an installation script. Docker would be even better -> Done

**Future Improvements**
=========

- Authentication/Accounts: There exist functionality to assign actions to people, using accounts one could see all relevants tasks for a certain person. Users with higher accsess could monitor employee productivity by checking the time completed of certain actions.

- More general overview: Right now you can just see what you have to do next (Besides being able to add/complete actions), with a higher-level overview you can see not just what you are doing now but what working towards. This would make the app feel much better to use.
